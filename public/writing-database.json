    "content": "Every great project starts with a story, and as a writer, I know the script is the foundation of everything. It’s not just words on a page; it’s the blueprint for what’s to come. As someone who also produces and edits, I’ve found that strong writing simplifies everything that follows.\n\nWhen writing, I think like a producer: Can this scene be shot on my budget? Do I have the resources to make this vision a reality? And when I’m editing, I rely on the script as a guide, revisiting its beats to ensure the final cut stays true to the original intent.\n\nWearing all three hats has taught me the importance of flexibility. Sometimes, what works on paper doesn’t translate on set or in the edit bay. Adapting without losing the essence of the story is key. Writing isn’t just the first step—it’s a thread that runs through the entire process."
