        </div>
        <p>Hi, I’m Dylan—a screenwriter and storyteller with a background in film, fiction, and narrative design. I’ve written over a dozen original screenplays across sci-fi, horror, drama, and thrillers, including <strong>Les Nettoyeurs</strong> (2022) and <strong>Santa Muerte</strong> (sold). My work has been recognized by the Austin Film Festival and has helped bring emotionally grounded genre stories to life on screen.</p>
        <p>Whether I’m writing a feature film, building a world for a game, or ghostwriting fiction, I approach every project with the same focus: character-first storytelling that hits hard. I’m drawn to stories about survival, grief, strange connections, and what it means to be human in a broken world.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for a writer who can create immersive narratives, sharp dialogue, and clean structure—I’d love to connect and see what we can build together.</p>
